Flexoki is an inky color scheme for prose and code. Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog inks and warm shades of paper.

Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.

Flexoki is [open-source](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki) under the MIT license. Flexoki is available for dozens of popular apps, including [[obsidian|Obsidian]] using my theme [[minimal|Minimal]].

## Syntax highlighting

[![](https://stephango.com/assets/flexoki-code.png "Flexoki syntax highlighting")](https://stephango.com/assets/flexoki-code.png)

## Why?

I created Flexoki for my personal site, [[stephango-com|stephango.com]]. You’re reading it now. I wanted the colors to feel distinctive yet familiar. Like ink on paper.

The name Flexoki comes from *[flexography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexography)* — a common printing process for paper and cardboard [^1]. I spent many years working with dyes and inks particularly for my companies [[inkodye|Inkodye]] and [[lumi|Lumi]]. I also have a fascination with [[the-elusiveness-of-digital-paper|digital paper]]. I wanted to bring the comfort of analog color to emissive digital screens.

One challenge is that ink on paper is a subtractive process whereas LCD and OLED screens use additive color. Replicating the effect of mixing pigments digitally is difficult. The following video illustrates the problem:

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JVjHqas60Q)

See the [full SIGGRAPH 2021 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch)

Mixing blue and yellow paint creates green, whereas digital color mixing results in a brownish hue. Watercolors retain their saturation when you dilute them, whereas reducing the opacity of digital colors makes them look desaturated.

Another challenge with digital color is [human perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_color_spaces_and_their_uses) across color spaces. For example, yellow appears much brighter than blue. Ethan Schoonover’s color scheme [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) (2011) was an important inspiration for Flexoki. His emphasis on lightness relationships in the [CIELAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space) color space helped me understand how to find colors that appear cohesive. Flexoki derives colors from the more recent [Oklab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space) color space to maintain those perceptual relationships at the light and dark ends of the spectrum — ramping up color intensity exponentially to emulate the vibrancy that pigments exhibit even when diluted.

I found that choosing colors with perfect perceptual consistency can be at odds with the distinctiveness of colors in practical applications like syntax highlighting. If you adhere too closely to evenness in perceptual lightness you can end up with a palette that looks washed out and difficult to parse.

This project has been a battle between my competing desires in science and art. One part of my brain searches for reliability and precision, while another part searches for those elusive [[scars|imperfections]] that remind us what feels *real*. Solving for all these problems is how I arrived at Flexoki. I hope you find it useful.

## Base color

Flexoki uses warm monochromatic base values that blend the black value with the paper value. 8 values are used in light and dark mode:

- **3 text values:** normal, muted, faint
- **3 interface values:** normal, hover, active
- **2 background values:** primary, secondary

Incremental values can be derived using opacity. For example, you can use a 60% opacity black value on top of the paper value to create the 600 value.

| Color | Hex | Light theme | Dark theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `black` | `#100F0F` | `tx` | `bg` |
| `base-950` | `#1C1B1A` |  | `bg-2` |
| `base-900` | `#282726` |  | `ui` |
| `base-850` | `#343331` |  | `ui-2` |
| `base-800` | `#403E3C` |  | `ui-3` |
| `base-700` | `#575653` |  | `tx-3` |
| `base-600` | `#6F6E69` | `tx-2` |  |
| `base-500` | `#878580` |  | `tx-2` |
| `base-300` | `#B7B5AC` | `tx-3` |  |
| `base-200` | `#CECDC3` | `ui-3` | `tx` |
| `base-150` | `#DAD8CE` | `ui-2` |  |
| `base-100` | `#E6E4D9` | `ui` |  |
| `base-50` | `#F2F0E5` | `bg-2` |  |
| `paper` | `#FFFCF0` | `bg` |  |

## Accent colors

8 accent colors are available for accents and syntax highlighting. Unlike the base values, accent values cannot be derived using opacity because this desaturates the pigment effect. Use the [[flexoki|extended palette]] for the full range of values.

The following 16 values are the main accent values used for syntax highlighting and interface elements like buttons and links. Light themes should use **600** for syntax highlighted text, dark themes should use **400**.

| Color | Hex | Light theme | Dark theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `red-600` | `#AF3029` | `re` | `re-2` |
| `orange-600` | `#BC5215` | `or` | `or-2` |
| `yellow-600` | `#AD8301` | `ye` | `ye-2` |
| `green-600` | `#66800B` | `gr` | `gr-2` |
| `cyan-600` | `#24837B` | `cy` | `cy-2` |
| `blue-600` | `#205EA6` | `bl` | `bl-2` |
| `purple-600` | `#5E409D` | `pu` | `pu-2` |
| `magenta-600` | `#A02F6F` | `ma` | `ma-2` |

| Color | Hex | Light theme | Dark theme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `red-400` | `#D14D41` | `re-2` | `re` |
| `orange-400` | `#DA702C` | `or-2` | `or` |
| `yellow-400` | `#D0A215` | `ye-2` | `ye` |
| `green-400` | `#879A39` | `gr-2` | `gr` |
| `cyan-400` | `#3AA99F` | `cy-2` | `cy` |
| `blue-400` | `#4385BE` | `bl-2` | `bl` |
| `purple-400` | `#8B7EC8` | `pu-2` | `pu` |
| `magenta-400` | `#CE5D97` | `ma-2` | `ma` |

## Extended palette

If you wish to use Flexoki for more complex applications beyond syntax highlighting and basic color schemes, the extended palette includes a complete set of values for every accent color from **50** to **950**.

Note that **paper** and **black** are special values that represent the lightest and darkest colors in the palette, equivalent to **0** and **1000**.

Flexoki emulates the feeling of pigment on paper by exponentially increasing intensity as colors get lighter or darker. This makes the colors feel vibrant and warm, like watercolor inks.
