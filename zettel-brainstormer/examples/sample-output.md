# Expected Output (after brainstorming)

## The Documentation Paradox

Quick observation: Projects with comprehensive docs often have less adoption than projects with minimal "just works" examples.

Why?

- Comprehensive docs signal complexity
- People want to copy-paste and go
- Reading is harder than doing
- Good defaults beat configuration options

Counter-intuitive but observable in the wild.

## 🧠 Brainstorming & Research (2026-02-11)

### 🧊 Core Insight: Signal vs. Noise

The documentation paradox reflects a deeper pattern: **comprehensiveness often creates cognitive overhead**. Users don't want to become experts—they want to solve their immediate problem.

This mirrors the "worse is better" philosophy from Richard Gabriel: systems that prioritize simplicity and ease of use beat technically superior but complex alternatives.

### 📚 References & Context

- **Richard Gabriel's "Worse is Better"**: Argues that simple, easily adoptable systems outcompete technically superior but complex ones
- **README-driven development**: Philosophy of starting with a minimal README that shows the happy path
- **Stripe API docs**: Famous for putting the most common use case front-and-center before diving into edge cases

### 🔍 Modern Examples

- **Vite vs. Webpack**: Vite's "works out of the box" approach vs Webpack's configuration hell
- **Next.js adoption**: Succeeded partly because early docs focused on "create-next-app" with zero config
- **Rust's ownership docs**: Initially scared people away; later versions added "start here" quick-start paths

### 💡 Design Principle

**Progressive disclosure**: Show the 80% use case first, hide the complexity until needed. Don't front-load cognitive load.
